    "# 一、中缀表达式\n",
    "中缀表达式是我们在日常生活和数学中最常用的表达式形式。让我为您详细解释中缀表达式的概念、特点和作用。\n",
    "\n",
    "中缀表达式的定义：\n",
    "中缀表达式是一种算术表达式的书写方式，其中操作符位于操作数之间。例如：3 + 4、(5 - 2) * 6。\n",
    "\n",
    "特点：\n",
    "1. 操作符位置：操作符位于两个操作数之间。\n",
    "2. 易读性：对人类来说，这是最容易阅读和理解的表达式形式。\n",
    "3. 优先级：使用括号来明确表示运算优先级。\n",
    "\n",
    "作用：\n",
    "1. 直观表达：最接近人类思维方式的数学表达形式。\n",
    "2. 日常使用：在日常书写和交流中广泛使用。\n",
    "3. 编程输入：许多编程语言使用中缀表达式作为算术表达式的输入形式。\n",
    "\n",
    "然而，中缀表达式也有一些限制，特别是在计算机处理方面：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 解析复杂：相比前缀或后缀表达式，计算机解析中缀表达式更复杂。\n",
    "2. 需要额外处理：计算机通常需要将中缀表达式转换为其他形式（如后缀表达式）来进行计算。\n",
    "\n",
    "为了更好地理解中缀表达式，让我们看一个简单的例子：\n"
